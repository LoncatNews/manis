Do you ever think about me
When she ain't around is your bed cold without me
Does her love feel just the same
Is she the one to take your last name
Whatever the case I'm glad you're happy
There ain't nothin' for me out here
Technicolor sparks fly in this city but not for me maybe next year
Yeah magic air charmin' lips but I'm never spellbound
Honestly though I'm glad you found her
I'll stop asking questions you take care
Yeah
And no I don't want you back
We've grown older and apart
Rediscovered myself took back my heart
Moved to a new city where I should be restartin'
But I just feel nothin'
Though something could grow
I don't ever let it take root oh
Possibility all round me
But I don't give a shit yeah
Numb to the bone been so long
Since the love bug bit
I'll admit maybe I quit
December's feelin chilly
Takin' shots at the club to warm up and distract me from feelin empty
Every now and then I would remember how you made me feel
Oh desolation and thrill
Maybe I should try love again but I don't no
To hell with other halves
That's bullshit I'm already whole alone
That don't mean that I wanna be alone
Tangled bodies to reset my heart but it just won't
But I ain't bitter babe
I've moved on I just hate that nothing blooms since you uh
Possibility all round me
But I don't give a shit yeah
Numb to the bone been so long
Since the love bug bit
I'll admit maybe I quit
